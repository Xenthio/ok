			Dungeon Cli is a project that me and my buddy Daniel decided to take on when he said<br>
			he wanted to make a game. I suggested a dungeon crawler thinking it would be a fun and great learning experience.<br>
			I never expected to get this far in making it. Thanks Daniel for letting me help
			<p>

			xScript is a syntax highlighting text editor for Unix/Linux shell scripts
			<p>
			xScript was simply me trying to learn Java. I simply made it because i wanted to make<br>
			a crossplatform version of another thing i made, this ended up being better. However
			it's very sloppy and is probably not the best way of doing things.
